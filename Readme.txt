a0poster Portrait Poster

Original description:
This poster features a clean portrait layout with a large header section housing important information about the poster and space for a logo of your institution or a photo of you. Poster content is neatly divided into two columns which is typical for a poster with a portrait orientation. The number of columns can easily be changed if you would like more room for text. The template features the ability to easily change the color of any section or element and shows this off with several examples (e.g. the color of the introduction and conclusions sections). A diversity of colors are available for selection, see here for a full list with examples. Examples of a table, wrapped table, figure, equation, list and bibliography are present in the template to provide a starting point for any requirement you may have for your own poster.
